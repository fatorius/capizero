# Downloads the UHO (Unbalanced Human Openings) test book, a popular public
# opening suite used by engine testers (OpenBench, CCRL, etc.) for SPRT work.
#
# More diverse than starter.epd and designed to avoid boring draws. Prefer
# this book over starter.epd once you're running serious SPRTs.
#
# Usage (from repo root):
#   bash tests/sprt/book/download_uho.sh
#
# The script downloads to tests/sprt/book/. If the URL below breaks, check
# https://github.com/official-stockfish/books for an up-to-date mirror and
# update BOOK_URL.
